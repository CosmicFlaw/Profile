# Introduction

Hello Everyone, I am Cosmic Flaw!
I am a programmer and game developer with a love for computers and everything related to them.

I know C, Python, HTML, CSS, QBasic (if it is still alive) and GDScript and am currently learning C++, Command Prompt, GLSL and Arduino Sketch.

I use the Godot Game Engine for making games and VSCode for other programming projects.
I am currently working on a website for spreading awareness about climate change and a RPG Platformer game.

I am looking forward to collaborating with an artist for my new game because even though I code fairly well, I am a terrible, terrible artist.

Other Applications that I use (for game development) or am familiar with are Blender, Krita, Inkscape, Bosca Ceoil, Wix, Arduino and Tinkercad.

You can find me on Github (of course), Itch.io and Stack Overflow, as 'CosmicFlaw'.
Apart from game development, my other hobbies include reading novels, tinkering and making digital art.


If you want to collaborate, know more or anything else, reach out to me. I will be more than happy to help.

Thank You!!
